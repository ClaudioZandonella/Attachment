Description: In this repository we collect all the material of the study “Evaluating Informative Hypotheses With Equality and Inequality Constraint: The Bayes Factor Encompassing Prior Approach”. The aim of the paper is to provide a clear and detailed description of the Bayes Factor with the encompassing prior approach considering an applied example regarding attachment theory. The pre-print version of the article is available at [TODO: add link]. The Supplemental Material with all the analyses is available at https://claudiozandonella.github.io/Attachment/.
