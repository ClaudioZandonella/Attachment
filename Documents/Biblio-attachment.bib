  abstract = {Considers the concepts of attachment and attachment behavior from an ethological-evolutionary viewpoint. Attachment behavior and exploration are viewed in balance, and the biological functions of each are discussed. The behavior of 56 white, middle-class infants, 49-51 wk. old in a strange situation was investigated. The presence of the mother encouraged exploratory behavior, her absence depressed exploration and heightened attachment behaviors. In separation episodes such behaviors as crying and search increased. In reunion episodes proximity-seeking and contact-maintaining behaviors were heightened. In a substantial proportion of Ss, contact-resisting behaviors were also heightened in the reunion episodes usually in conjunction with contact-maintaining behaviors, thus suggesting ambivalence. Some Ss also displayed proximity-avoiding behavior in relation to the mother in the reunion episodes. Findings are discussed in the context of relevant observational, clinical, and experimental studies of human and nonhuman primates. (42 ref.)

  abstract = {In the social and behavioral sciences, it is often not interesting to evaluate the null hypothesis by means of a p-value. Researchers are often more interested in quantifying the evidence in the data (as opposed to using p-values) with respect to their own expectations represented by equality and/or inequality constrained hypotheses (as opposed to the null hypothesis). This article proposes an Akaiketype information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973, 1974) called the generalized order-restricted information criterion approximation (GORICA) that evaluates (in)equality constrained hypotheses under a very broad range of statistical models. The results of five simulation studies provide empirical evidence showing that the performance of the GORICA on selecting the best hypothesis out of a set of (in)equality constrained hypotheses is convincing. To illustrate the use of the GORICA, the expectations of researchers are investigated in a logistic regression, multilevel regression, and structural equation model.},

  abstract = {[We consider that observations come from a general normal linear model and that it is desirable to test a simplifying null hypothesis about the parameters. We approach this problem from an objective Bayesian, model-selection perspective. Crucial ingredients for this approach are 'proper objective priors' to be used for deriving the Bayes factors. Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow priors have good properties for testing null hypotheses defined by specific values of the parameters in full-rank linear models. We extend these priors to deal with general hypotheses in general linear models, not necessarily of full rank. The resulting priors, which we call 'conventional priors', are expressed as a generalization of recently introduced 'partially informative distributions'. The corresponding Bayes factors are fully automatic, easily computed and very reasonable. The methodology is illustrated for the change-point problem and the equality of treatments effects problem. We compare the conventional priors derived for these problems with other objective Bayesian proposals like the intrinsic priors. It is concluded that both priors behave similarly although interesting subtle differences arise. We adapt the conventional priors to deal with nonnested model selection as well as multiple-model comparison. Finally, we briefly address a generalization of conventional priors to nonnormal scenarios.]}

  abstract = {In statistical practice, researchers commonly focus on patterns in the means of multiple dependent outcomes while treating variances as nuisance parameters. However, in fact, there are often substantive reasons to expect certain patterns in the variances of dependent outcomes as well. For example, in a repeated measures study, one may expect the variance of the outcome to increase over time if the difference between subjects becomes more pronounced over time because the subjects respond differently to a given treatment. Such expectations can be formulated as order constrained hypotheses on the variances of the dependent outcomes. Currently, however, no methods exist for testing such hypotheses in a direct manner. To fill this gap, we develop a Bayes factor for this challenging testing problem. Our Bayes factor is based on the multivariate normal distribution with an unstructured covariance matrix, which is often used to model dependent outcomes. Order constrained hypotheses can then be formulated on the variances on the diagonal of the covariance matrix. To compute Bayes factors between multiple order constrained hypotheses, a prior distribution needs to be specified under every hypothesis to be tested. Here, we use the encompassing prior approach in which priors under order constrained hypotheses are truncations of the prior under the unconstrained hypothesis. The resulting Bayes factor is fully automatic in the sense that no subjective priors need to be specified by the user.},

In this study, we used individual participant data meta-analysis to assess whether early attachment networks with mothers and fathers are associated with children’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Following a pre-registered protocol, data from 9 studies and 1,097 children (mean age: 28.67 months) with attachment classifications to both mothers and fathers were included in analyses. We used a linear mixed effects analysis to assess differences in children’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms as assessed via the average of both maternal and paternal reports based on whether children had two, one, or no insecure (or disorganized) attachments. Results indicated that children with an insecure attachment relationship with one or both parents were at higher risk for elevated internalizing symptomatology compared with children who were securely attached to both parents. Children whose attachment relationships with both parents were classified as disorganized had more externalizing symptoms compared to children with either one or no disorganized attachment relationship with their parents. Across attachment classification networks and symptoms, findings suggest (a) a multiplicative effect when children have insecure or disorganized attachment to both parents, and (b) that mother-child and fatherchild attachment relationships may not differ in the roles they play in children’s development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.},

  abstract = {In the Bayesian approach to model selection and hypothesis testing, the Bayes factor plays a central role. However, the Bayes factor is very sensitive to prior distributions of parameters. This is a problem especially in the presence of weak prior information on the parameters of the models. The most radical consequence of this fact is that the Bayes factor is undetermined when improper priors are used. Nonetheless, extending the non-informative approach of Bayesian analysis to model selection/testing procedures is important both from a theoretical and an applied viewpoint. The need to develop automatic and robust methods for model comparison has led to the introduction of several alternative Bayes factors. In this paper we review one of these methods: the fractional Bayes factor (O'Hagan, 1995). We discuss general properties of the method, such as consistency and coherence. Furthermore, in addition to the original, essentially asymptotic justifications of the fractional Bayes factor, we provide further finite-sample motivations for its use. Connections and comparisons to other automatic methods are discussed and several issues of robustness with respect to priors and data are considered. Finally, we focus on some open problems in the fractional Bayes factor approach, and outline some possible answers and directions for future research. /// Dans l'approche Bayesienne relative \&\#xe0; la s\&\#xe9;lection d'un model et \&\#xe0; la v\&\#xe9;rification d'une hypoth\&\#xe8;se, le facteur de Bayes joue une r\&\#xf4;le fondamental.

  abstract = {Due to some widely known critiques of traditional hypothesis testing, Bayesian hypothesis testing using the Bayes factor has been considered as a better alternative. Previous research about the influence of the prior focuses on the prior for the effect size and there is a debate about how to specify the prior. Thus, the focus of this paper is to explore the impact of different priors on the population mean and variance separately (separate priors) on the Bayes factor, and compare the separate priors with the priors on the effect size. Our simulation results show that both the prior distributions on mean and variance have a considerable influence on the Bayes factor, and different types of priors (different separate priors and priors on the effect size) have different influence patterns. We also find that regardless of separate priors or priors on the effect size, and shapes and centers of the priors, different priors could yield similar Bayes factors. Because noninformative prior distributions bias the Bayes factor in support of the null hypothesis, and very informative priors could be risky, we suggest that researchers use weakly informative priors as reasonable priors and they are expected to provide similar conclusions across different shapes and centers of prior distributions. Conducting sensitivity analysis is helpful in examining the influence of prior distributions and specifying reasonable prior distributions for the Bayes factor. A real data example is used to illustrate how to choose reasonable priors by a sensitivity analysis. We hope our results will help researchers choose prior distributions when conducting Bayesian hypothesis testing.},

  abstract = {Self-report measures of adult attachment are typically scored in ways (e.g., averaging or summing items) that can lead to erroneous inferences about important theoretical issues, such as the degree of continuity in attachment security and the differential stability of insecure attachment patterns. To determine whether existing attachment scales suffer from scaling problems, the authors conducted an item response theory (IRT) analysis of 4 commonly used self-report inventories: Experiences in Close Relationships scales (K. A. Brennan, C. L. Clark, \& P. R. Shaver, 1998), Adult Attachment Scales (N. L. Collins \& S. J. Read, 1990), Relationship Styles Questionnaire (D. W. Griffin \& K. Bartholomew, 1994) and J. Simpson's (1990) attachment scales. Data from 1,085 individuals were analyzed using F. Samejima's (1969) graded response model. The authors' findings indicate that commonly used attachment scales can be improved in a number of important ways. Accordingly, the authors show how IRT techniques can be used to develop new attachment scales with desirable psychometric properties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

  abstract = {In modeling defect counts collected from an established manufacturing processes, there are usually a relatively large number of zeros (non-defects). The commonly used models such as Poisson or Geometric distributions can underestimate the zero-defect probability and hence make it difficult to identify significant covariate effects to improve production quality. This article introduces a flexible class of zero inflated models which includes other familiar models such as the Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) models, as special cases. A Bayesian estimation method is developed as an alternative to traditionally used maximum likelihood based methods to analyze such data. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has better finite sample performance than the classical method with tighter interval estimates and better coverage probabilities. A real-life data set is analyzed to illustrate the practicability of the proposed method easily implemented using WinBUGS.},

Closely similar versions are completed by parents, teachers, and young people aged 11 or more. The validation study involved two groups of 5–15-year-olds: a community sample (N=467) and a psychiatric clinic sample (N=232). The two groups had markedly different distributions on the measures of perceived difficulties, impact (distress plus social impairment), and burden. Impact scores were better than symptom scores at discriminating between the community and clinic samples; discrimination based on the single “Is there a problem?” item was almost as good. The SDQ burden rating correlated well (r=.74) with a standardised interview rating of burden. For clinicians and researchers with an interest in psychiatric caseness and the determinants of service use, the impact supplement of the extended SDQ appears to provide useful additional information without taking up much more of respondents' time.},

There is theoretical and preliminary empirical support for combining the SDQ’s hypothesised emotional and peer subscales into an ‘internalizing’ subscale and the hypothesised behavioral and hyperactivity subscales into an ‘externalizing’ subscale (alongside the fifth prosocial subscale). We examine this using parent, teacher and youth SDQ data from a representative sample of 5–16 year olds in Britain (N = 18,222). Factor analyses generally supported second-order internalizing and externalizing factors, and the internalizing and externalizing subscales showed good convergent and discriminant validity across informants and with respect to clinical disorder. By contrast, discriminant validity was poorer between the emotional and peer subscales and between the behavioral, hyperactivity and prosocial subscales. This applied particularly to children with low scores on those subscales. We conclude that there are advantages to using the broader internalizing and externalizing SDQ subscales for analyses in low-risk samples, while retaining all five subscales when screening for disorder.},

In most applications, however, the marginal likelihood is not analytically tractable and must be approximated using numerical methods. Here we provide a tutorial on bridge sampling (Bennett, 1976; Meng \& Wong, 1996), a reliable and relatively straightforward sampling method that allows researchers to obtain the marginal likelihood for models of varying complexity. First, we introduce bridge sampling and three related sampling methods using the beta-binomial model as a running example. We then apply bridge sampling to estimate the marginal likelihood for the Expectancy Valence (EV) model—a popular model for reinforcement learning. Our results indicate that bridge sampling provides accurate estimates for both a single participant and a hierarchical version of the EV model. We conclude that bridge sampling is an attractive method for mathematical psychologists who typically aim to approximate the marginal likelihood for a limited set of possibly high-dimensional models.},

The software package BIG is provided such that psychologists can use the approach proposed for the analysis of their own data. To illustrate the approximate Bayes procedure and the use of BIG, we evaluate inequality constrained hypotheses in a path model and a logistic regression model. Two simulation studies on the performance of our approximate Bayes procedure show that it results in accurate Bayes factors.},

We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined—what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

  abstract = {Learning about hypothesis evaluation using the Bayes factor could enhance psychological research. In contrast to null-hypothesis significance testing it renders the evidence in favor of each of the hypotheses under consideration (it can be used to quantify support for the null-hypothesis) instead of a dichotomous reject/do-not-reject decision; it can straightforwardly be used for the evaluation of multiple hypotheses without having to bother about the proper manner to account for multiple testing; and it allows continuous reevaluation of hypotheses after additional data have been collected (Bayesian updating). This tutorial addresses researchers considering to evaluate their hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor. The focus is completely applied and each topic discussed is illustrated using Bayes factors for the evaluation of hypotheses in the context of an ANOVA model, obtained using the R package bain. Readers can execute all the analyses presented while reading this tutorial if they download bain and the R-codes used. It will be elaborated in a completely nontechnical manner: what the Bayes factor is, how it can be obtained, how Bayes factors should be interpreted, and what can be done with Bayes factors. After reading this tutorial and executing the associated code, researchers will be able to use their own data for the evaluation of hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor, not only in the context of ANOVA models, but also in the context of other statistical models.},

This article deals with estimation and model selection in linear mixed models with inequality constraints on the parameters. It is shown that different theories can be translated into statistical models by putting constraints on the model parameters yielding a set of competing models. A new approach based on the principle of encompassing priors is proposed and used to compute Bayes factors and subsequently posterior model probabilities. Model selection is based on posterior model probabilities. The approach is illustrated using a longitudinal data set.},

  abstract = {A growing body of research has established that individuals who form secure attachments in early childhood or adolescence experience better social adjustment and mental health outcomes. Yet the important years between ages 6 and 12 have been relatively neglected in the literature. This volume is the first to bring together emerging theories and findings on attachment in middle childhood, including the results of key longitudinal studies. With contributions from leading investigators, the book explores the effects on attachment of a wide range of factors in middle childhood, including children's broadening network of social relationships. Data are presented on whether the quality of attachment in middle childhood can be predicted by assessments earlier in life, and what may explain changes over time. Chapters examine the implications of attachment for children's social and emotional functioning, their academic development, and the later emergence of adolescent problems. Also considered are challenges in conceptualizing and assessing attachment during this period, and the strengths and limitations of existing measurement approaches. The concluding chapter offers a thought-provoking commentary on the volume's major themes, identifying areas of scientific progress and highlighting questions and problems that still need to be addressed.

In the approach described, the Bayes factor for a constrained model with the encompassing model reduces to the ratio of two proportions, namely the proportion of, respectively, the encompassing prior and posterior in agreement with the constraints. This enables easy and straightforward estimation of the Bayes factor and its Monte Carlo Error. In this set-up, the issue of sensitivity to model specific prior distributions reduces to sensitivity to one prior distribution, that is, the prior for the encompassing model. It is shown that for specific classes of inequality constrained models, the Bayes factors for the constrained with the unconstrained model is virtually independent of the encompassing prior, that is, model selection is virtually objective.},

The concept of encompassing priors is introduced, that is, a prior distribution for an unconstrained model from which the prior distributions of the constrained models can be derived. It is shown that the Bayes factor for the encompassing and a constrained model has a very nice interpretation: it is the ratio of the proportion of the prior and posterior distribution of the encompassing model in agreement with the constrained model. It is also shown that, for a specific class of models, selection based on encompassing priors will render a virtually objective selection procedure.

In this article, a Bayesian approach to evaluate analysis of variance or analysis of covariance models with inequality constraints on the (adjusted) means is presented. This evaluation contains two issues: estimation of the parameters given the restrictions using the Gibbs sampler and model selection using Bayes factors in the case of competing theories.

With these criteria, (non-)nested models can be compared. This comes down to evaluating equalities (e.g., setting some paths equal or to 0). These criteria cannot evaluate inequality restrictions on the parameters, while the AIC-type criterion called GORICA can. For example, GORICA can evaluate the hypothesis stating that one predictor has more (standardized) strength than some other predictors. This paper illustrates inequality-constrained hypoth­ esis-evaluation in SEM models using the GORICA (in R). Examples will be presented for confirmatory factor analysis, latent regression, and multigroup latent regression.},

  abstract = {The Akaike information criterion for model selection presupposes that the parameter space is not subject to order restrictions or inequality constraints. Anraku (1999) proposed a modified version of this criterion, called the order-restricted information criterion, for model selection in the one-way analysis of variance model when the population means are monotonic. We propose a generalization of this to the case when the population means may be restricted by a mixture of linear equality and inequality constraints. If the model has no inequality constraints, then the generalized order-restricted information criterion coincides with the Akaike information criterion. Thus, the former extends the applicability of the latter to model selection in multi-way analysis of variance models when some models may have inequality constraints while others may not. Simulation shows that the information criterion proposed in this paper performs well in selecting the correct model.},

Yet, evidence concerning its validity in middle childhood is limited. This study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the 12-item ECR-RC for both mother and father forms in a sample of 448 Italian children (50.2\% girls) aged between 8 and 13 years. The scale was adapted by changing the response format to make it more understandable for young children. Psychometric proprieties of the brief ECR-RC were investigated by testing its factor structure and internal consistency, invariance across middle childhood and early adolescence, and concurrent and convergent validity. A series of confirmatory factor analyses provided support for the two-factor structure (i.e., anxiety and avoidance) of the ECR-RC, and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses supported its invariance across middle childhood and early adolescence. Older children reported significantly higher latent mean values in avoidant attachment to both parents compared to their younger counterparts. Furthermore, the questionnaire showed evidence of concurrent and convergent validity. Our results indicate that the 12-item version of the ECR-RC is a psychometrically robust instrument to assess avoidance and anxiety toward mother and father among Italian children and early adolescents.}

  abstract = {Correlation coefficients play a key role in the social and behavioral sciences for quantifying the degree of linear association between variables. A Bayes factor is proposed that allows researchers to test hypotheses with order constraints on correlation coefficients in a direct manner. This Bayes factor balances between fit and complexity of order-constrained hypotheses in a natural way. A diffuse prior on the correlation matrix is used that minimizes prior shrinkage and results in most evidence for an order-constrained hypothesis that is supported by the data. An efficient method is proposed for the computation of the Bayes factor.

  abstract = {Measures of association play a central role in the social sciences to quantify the strength of a linear relationship between the variables of interest. In many applications researchers can translate scientific expectations to hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints on these measures of association. In this paper a Bayes factor test is proposed for testing multiple hypotheses with constraints on the measures of association between ordinal and/or continuous variables, possibly after correcting for certain covariates. This test can be used to obtain a direct answer to the research question how much evidence there is in the data for a social science theory relative to competing theories. The accompanying software package ‘BCT’ allows users to apply the methodology in an easy manner. An empirical application from leisure studies about the associations between life, leisure and relationship satisfaction and an application about the differences about egalitarian justice beliefs across countries are used to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract = {There have been considerable methodological developments of Bayes factors for hypothesis testing in the social and behavioral sciences, and related fields. This development is due to the flexibility of the Bayes factor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, the ability to test complex hypotheses involving equality as well as order constraints on the parameters of interest, and the interpretability of the outcome as the weight of evidence provided by the data in support of competing scientific theories. The available software tools for Bayesian hypothesis testing are still limited however. In this paper we present a new R package called BFpack that contains functions for Bayes factor hypothesis testing for the many common testing problems. The software includes novel tools for (i) Bayesian exploratory testing (e.g., zero vs positive vs negative effects), (ii) Bayesian confirmatory testing (competing hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints), (iii) common statistical analyses, such as linear regression, generalized linear models, (multivariate) analysis of (co)variance, correlation analysis, and random intercept models, (iv) using default priors, and (v) while allowing data to contain missing observations that are missing at random.},

The BIC, however, is not suitable for evaluating models with order constraints on the parameters of interest. This article explores two extensions of the BIC for evaluating order-constrained models, one where a truncated unit information prior is used under the order-constrained model and the other where a truncated local unit information prior is used. The first prior is centered on the maximum likelihood estimate, and the latter prior is centered on a null value. Several analyses show that the order-constrained BIC based on the local unit information prior works better as an Occam’s razor for evaluating order-constrained models and results in lower error probabilities. The methodology based on the local unit information prior is implemented in the R package “BICpack” which allows researchers to easily apply the method for order-constrained model selection. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using data from the European Values Study.},

The prior that is used under the unconstrained model is the conjugate expected-constrained posterior prior and the prior under the constrained model is proportional to the unconstrained prior truncated in the constrained space. This results in Bayes factors that appropriately balance between model fit and complexity for a broad class of constrained models. When the set of equality and/or inequality constraints in the model represents a hypothesis that applied researchers have in, for instance, (M)AN(C)OVA, (multivariate) regression, or repeated measurements, the obtained Bayes factor can be used to determine how much evidence is provided by the data in favor of the hypothesis in comparison to the unconstrained model. If several hypotheses are under investigation, the Bayes factors between the constrained models can be calculated using the obtained Bayes factors from BIEMS. Furthermore, posterior model probabilities of constrained models are provided which allows the user to compare the models directly with each other.},

However, there are difficulties with this approach when prior information about the parameters of the various models is weak. Partial Bayes factors offer a resolution of the problem by setting aside part of the data as a training sample. The training sample is used to obtain an initial informative posterior distribution of the parameters in each model. Model comparison is then based on a Bayes factor calculated from the remaining data. Properties of partial Bayes factors are discussed, particularly in the context of weak prior information, and they are found to have advantages over other proposed methods of model comparison. A new variant of the partial Bayes factor, the fractional Bayes factor, is advocated on grounds of consistency, simplicity, robustness and coherence.]}

  abstract = {The objective was to extend a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model to account for correlated genetic effects, and to use this model to analyze the number of clinical mastitis cases in Norwegian Red cows. The ZIP model is suitable for analysis of count data containing an excess of zeros relative to what is expected from Poisson sampling. A ZIP model was developed and compared with a corresponding Poisson model. The Poisson parameter followed a hierarchical structure, and a residual term accounting for overdispersion was included. In both models, the Poisson parameter was regressed 1) on the year, month, and age at first calving; 2) on the logarithm of the number of days elapsed from calving to the end of first lactation; and c) on herd and sire effects. Herd and sire effects were assigned normal prior distributions in a Bayesian analysis, corresponding to a random effects treatment in a frequentist analysis. An analysis of residuals favored the Poisson model when there were 2 or more cases of mastitis during first lactation, with very small differences between the ZIP and Poisson models at 0 and 1 cases. However, the residual assessment was not satisfactory for either of the models. The ZIP model, on the other hand, had a better predictive ability than the corresponding Poisson model. Posterior means of the sire, herd, and residual variances in the ZIP model (log scale) were 0.09, 0.37, and 0.36, respectively, highlighting the importance of herds as a source of variation in clinical mastitis. The correlation between sire rankings from the ZIP and Poisson models was 0.98. A weaker correlation would be expected in a population with more severe inflation at zero than the present one. The estimate of the perfect state probability p was 0.32, indicating that 32\% of the animals would be in the perfect state, either because they are resistant or because they were not exposed to mastitis.},

  abstract = {Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be “tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary ‘omnibus’ F test” (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-tests. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. The utility of Bayesian methods, however, ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst’s domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To demonstrate this point, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative clause sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.

  abstract = {Inferences about hypotheses are ubiquitous in the cognitive sciences. Bayes factors provide one general way to compare different hypotheses by their compatibility with the observed data. Those quantifications can then also be used to choose between hypotheses. While Bayes factors provide an immediate approach to hypothesis testing, they are highly sensitive to details of the data/model assumptions. Moreover it’s not clear how straightforwardly this approach can be implemented in practice, and in particular how sensitive it is to the details of the computational implementation. Here, we investigate these questions for Bayes factor analyses in the cognitive sciences. We explain the statistics underlying Bayes factors as a tool for Bayesian inferences and discuss that utility functions are needed for principled decisions on hypotheses. Next, we study how Bayes factors misbehave under different conditions. This includes a study of errors in the estimation of Bayes factors. Importantly, it is unknown whether Bayes factor estimates based on bridge sampling are unbiased for complex analyses. We are the first to use simulation-based calibration as a tool to test the accuracy of Bayes factor estimates. Moreover, we study how stable Bayes factors are against different MCMC draws. We moreover study how Bayes factors depend on variation in the data. We also look at variability of decisions based on Bayes factors and how to optimize decisions using a utility function. We outline a Bayes factor workflow that researchers can use to study whether Bayes factors are robust for their individual analysis, and we illustrate this workflow using an example from the cognitive sciences. We hope that this study will provide a workflow to test the strengths and limitations of Bayes factors as a way to quantify evidence in support of scientific hypotheses.

  abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage–Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method’s validity, generality, and flexibility.},

  abstract = {An encompassing prior (EP) approach to facilitate Bayesian model selection for nested models with inequality constraints has been previously proposed. In this approach, samples are drawn from the prior and posterior distributions of an encompassing model that contains an inequality restricted version as a special case. The Bayes factor in favor of the inequality restriction then simplifies to the ratio of the proportions of posterior and prior samples consistent with the inequality restriction. This formalism has been applied almost exclusively to models with inequality or “about equality” constraints. It is shown that the EP approach naturally extends to exact equality constraints by considering the ratio of the heights for the posterior and prior distributions at the point that is subject to test (i.e.,~the Savage–Dickey density ratio). The EP approach generalizes the Savage–Dickey ratio method, and can accommodate both inequality and exact equality constraints. The general EP approach is found to be a computationally efficient procedure to calculate Bayes factors for nested models. However, the EP approach to exact equality constraints is vulnerable to the Borel–Kolmogorov paradox, the consequences of which warrant careful consideration.},
